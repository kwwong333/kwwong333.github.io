This paper investigates the influence of sliding bubbles on heat transfer in laminar flow at high Prandtl number using interface resolving simulation tool, PSI-BOIL. The study arises from the critical role that helium gases play in the operation of molten salt fast reactors (MSFR), particularly in the removal of fission products from the reactor's core. During this process, helium gases, along with other volatile fission products, have the potential to infiltrate the channels of the intermediate heat exchanger. Understanding the impact of these gases on heat transfer is paramount, especially in contexts where laminar flow regimes are present, to ensure the optimal and safe operation of the MSFR.

This is published in the special issue of the Advances in Thermal Hydraulics (ATH'20) and is a result of the MSc thesis conducted at Paul Scherrer Institute.
