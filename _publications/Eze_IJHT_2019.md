The paper investigated the effectivness of vortex generator in the mitigation of HTD phenomenon in supercritical water upward flow using ANSYS FLUENT, and discussed the mechanism behind the mitigation using turbulent kinetic energy and radial velocity distribution.

This second-coauthored paper is the result of the collaboration with the previous research team under Prof. Jiyun Zhao at the City University of Hong Kong.
