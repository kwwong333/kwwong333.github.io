## Abstract

This thesis evaluates the efficacy of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in simulating fluid dynamics challenges, focusing on the Burgers' equation and the lid-driven cavity problem, to develop a robust PINN framework for nuclear engineering applications such as the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Research In Sweden (SUNRISE) project. The research compares various PINN models to traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to enhance predictive accuracy and computational efficiency for reactor design.

The study analyses and optimises diverse PINN configurations, employing automatic and numerical differentiation techniques and their integrative approaches, while investigating the incorporation of advanced artificial viscosity methods to augment model robustness and address limitations of standalone PINN methods.

Results show that enhanced PINN strategies achieve superior accuracy in solving the Burgers' equation and the lid-driven cavity problem at increased Reynolds numbers. For the Burgers' equation, one method with artificial viscosity achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 1.19⨉10⁻³. For the lid-driven cavity problem at Re 1000, another method without artificial viscosity yielded MSEs of 2.27⨉10⁻⁴, 9.54⨉10⁻⁵, and 1.81⨉10⁻⁵ for u, v, and p, respectively. These advancements highlight the potential of PINNs in nuclear engineering applications, particularly in tackling flow-accelerated corrosion and erosion in lead-cooled fast reactors within the SUNRISE project.
