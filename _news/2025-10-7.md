## Abstract
The dissolution of austenitic steel in liquid lead-based alloys can induce a phase transformation characterized by a sharp dissolution front separating ferrite and austenite grains, a process commonly referred to as ferritization. Although widely reported, the mechanism driving this transformation remains under debate. This study re-examines ferritization as a discontinuous reaction via a migrating liquid film and proposes a thermodynamically consistent model for the initiation and propagation of the dissolution front. The proposed mechanism is supported by experiments at 500–550°C, literature evidence, and diffusion calculations. Under low oxygen conditions, Cr transport through liquid Pb channels is identified as the rate-limiting step, setting the theoretical corrosion rate in stagnant environments. High-speed erosion-corrosion tests show enhanced corrosion rates, driven by erosion-limited channel lengths that locally boost mass transport. In contrast, under moderate oxygen concentrations relevant for lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR) operation, the rate-limiting step shifts to metal transport across a nanometer-scale amorphous oxide layer at the reaction front. Other Ni-containing austenitic steels, including alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) alloys and Ni-based high-entropy alloys (HEAs) can also be susceptible to discontinuous reactions under direct contact with liquid Pb-based alloys, lacking the self-healing oxide protection as observed in alumina-forming ferritic steels. This limitation may present a concern for the long-term use of bare austenitic steel in liquid Pb environments.
