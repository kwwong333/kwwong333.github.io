My conference poster on “Enabling Passive Scalar Wall Modelling in Large Eddy Simulation for Turbulent Flows at High Schmidt or Prandtl Numbers” got the Best Poster Award from ICONE-31. 

The conference paper aims to allow efficient simulation of turbulent mass transfer process in flow-accelerated corrosion applications.
