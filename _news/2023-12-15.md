## Abstract
Flow-accelerated corrosion and erosion (FACE) phenomena can be crucial for performance of structural elements in heavy liquid metal (HLM) cooled reactor systems. Existing experimental observations indicate that turbulent flow characteristic can affect FACE, but there is no quantitative data that can be used for model development and validation. Main recirculation pump impellers, which operate at high relative velocities and rotational flow conditions can be especially vulnerable to FACE. For comparison, the core internals operate at lower velocities and in axial flow conditions, but at higher temperatures and neutron fluence. Hence, systematic experimental data is needed to improve our knowledge on FACE phenomena. The Separate Effect Test Facility for Flow-Accelerated Corrosion and Erosion (SEFACE) is designed to obtain such experimental data including high relative velocities (up 20 ms−1) and high temperatures (400 to 550 °C) of liquid lead. This article focuses on the hydrodynamic design of SEFACE. The aim of the design is to achieve well defined flow conditions for experiments and ensure safe operation of the facility. First, we examine three design concepts (i.e., forced convection loop, rotating cylinder, and rotating disk) and motivate the choice of the rotating disk approach for SEFACE. Second, we discuss different design options, i.e., a confined rotor–stator test chamber and the unconfined rotating disk configuration. We used Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) calculations to identify and solve the issues stemming from the high rotational speed. These include, for instance, lead free surface deformation, radial pressure buildup, and axial bending forces due to asymmetric test chamber. The CFD-derived torque and power predictions in rotor–stator and rotating disk systems are verified with selected empirical turbulent friction factor correlations or/and DNS calculations. We demonstrate that the developed hydrodynamic design of SEFACE solves identified issues and enables obtaining experimental data under well-defined flow conditions. The findings are deemed to also be applicable to the design of rotating disk-type FACE installations for other liquid mediums.
