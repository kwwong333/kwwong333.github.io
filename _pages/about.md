I am Kin Wing Wong, a Ph.D. candidate specializing in [Nuclear Engineering](https://www.reactor.sci.kth.se/nuclear-engineering-1.792022) at the [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se) in Stockholm, Sweden. Prior to my Ph.D. studies at KTH from 2022, I pursued and completed my Bachelor’s and Master's degrees in Nuclear Engineering, with my studies spanning across the [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/mne/programmes/undergraduate/bachelor-engineering-nuclear-and-risk-engineering), [EPFL, and ETH Zürich](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/nuclear-engineering/). Following my graduation at the Master's level in 2019, I embarked on a professional journey as a System Code Developer for thermal hydralic and servere accideint phenmenon, [ATHLET](https://user-codes.grs.de/athlet) and [ATHLET-CD](https://user-codes.grs.de/athlet-cd), at [Gesellschaft für Anlagen- und Reaktorsicherheit (GRS) gGmbH](https://www.grs.de/en), a position I held from 2019 to 2022

My academic journey is richly supported by my advisors, Dmitry Grishchenko and Pavel Kudinov, with whom I am delving deep into the complexities of lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR) modelling. Currently, my research is nested within the framework of the [SUNRISE (Sustainable Nuclear Energy Research In Sweden)](https://www.reactor.sci.kth.se/sunrise/sunrise-1.999712) project, an ambitious initiative aimed at advancing our understanding and modelling capabilities of Flow Accelerated Corrosion and Erosion (FACE) in Heavy Liquid Metals (HLMs). You can find more about the WP5 project [here](https://www.reactor.sci.kth.se/sunrise/sunrise-work-plan-1.999730).

In parallel, I am working in collaboration with the [Advanced Nuclear System Group, Paul Scherrer Institute](https://www.psi.ch/en/lsm/ans-group), developing cutting-edge three-dimensional interface tracking simulation tools tailored for diabatic compressible two-phase flows with phase changes to capture sodium chugging phenomenon. I am also interestd in the full regime wall boiling model implementation in system-level thermal hydraulic code.

I am open to collaborative opportunities, particularly those that strive to extend the frontiers of current knowledge and capabilities within computational studies. I have a keen interest in contributing to and advancing methodologies in turbulence flows, nuclear thermal hydraulics, nuclear materials, and multi-physics simulations.
