I am a Ph.D. student at the Division of Nuclear Engineering at KTH with Dmitry Grishchenko and Pavel Kudinov.

My research focuses on the modelling of flow accelerated corrosion and erosion (FACE) problem in heavy liquid metals (HLMs) within the SUNRISE (Sustainable Nuclear Energy Research In Sweden) project.

In addition, I am also developing interface tracking simulation tools for diabatic compressible two-phase flows wiht phase change, next-generaiton system code for the full-regime boiling phenomenon.
