I am Kin Wing Wong, a Ph.D. student at the [Division of Nuclear Engineering](https://www.reactor.sci.kth.se/nuclear-engineering-1.792022) at KTH Royal Institue of Technology at Stockholm, Sweden, working with my sueprvisors, Dmitry Grishchenko and Pavel Kudinov, on lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR) modelling issues.

My current research focuses on the modelling of flow accelerated corrosion and erosion (FACE) problem in heavy liquid metals (HLMs) within the [SUNRISE (Sustainable Nuclear Energy Research In Sweden)](https://www.sunrise-centre.se/) project. This project aims to develop and validate modeling techniques for understanding flow-accelerated corrosion and erosion (FACE) processes in HLM-cooled reactors. 

In addition, I am also developing interface tracking simulation tools for diabatic compressible two-phase flows wiht phase change, next-generaiton system code for the full-regime boiling phenomenon.
