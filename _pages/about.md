I am Kin Wing Wong, a Ph.D. candidate specializing in [Nuclear Engineering](https://www.reactor.sci.kth.se/nuclear-engineering-1.792022) at the [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se) in Stockholm, Sweden. 

My work focuses on the fundamental physics and multi-scale modeling of turbulent transport and corrosion–erosion phenomena in heavy liquid metal (HLM) systems, with direct relevance to next-generation nuclear technologies. I investigate how high Schmidt number turbulent flows regulate mass transfer, nucleation, particle growth and shrinkage, and material degradation at solid–liquid interfaces.

A central theme of my research is the development of integrated experimental–computational frameworks for interrogating flow-accelerated corrosion and erosion. 

- Experimentally, I contribute to the design and operation of high-temperature liquid-metal corrosion and rotating-disk erosion facilities that enable quantification of corrosion, oxide formation, and erosive material loss under well-characterized turbulent boundary layers. In addition, I conduct experimental investigations into the damage mechanisms of corrosion and erosion-assisted corrosion to develop a fundamental understanding of these processes in both conventional and advanced structural materials.
- Computationally, I develop hybrid numerical approaches that couple high-fidelity Eulerian CFD solvers with Lagrangian Random Walk Monte Carlo (RWMC) models to resolve non-local turbulent mixing, nucleation kinetics, and precipitation dynamics. In parallel, I am developing an immersed-boundary–based computational frameworks to study the two-way coupling between evolving surface topography and turbulent flow dynamics.

Computational Research Interests

- Turbulent scalar transport at high Schmidt number, including non-local flux modeling and fundamental mass-transfer mechanisms across diverse flow regimes.
- Corrosion, erosion, and oxidation in heavy liquid metal systems, with emphasis on multiscale coupling between turbulence, interfacial reaction kinetics, and material degradation pathways.
- Nucleation, growth, shrinkage, and dissolution of oxide particles, integrating classical nucleation theory with direct numerical simulation (DNS), Lagrangian RWMC, and population-balance modelling.
- Advanced numerical methods, including immersed-boundary and level-set hybrid schemes, high-order discretizations for evolving interfaces, and GPU-accelerated solvers for high-fidelity simulations.

Experimental Research Interests

- Rotating boundary-layer–driven mass transfer, particularly in systems where centrifugal and Coriolis effects govern corrosion and dissolution processes, such as pump impellers and rotating disks.
- High-temperature liquid-metal corrosion and erosion studies, using rotating-disk facilities to quantify oxide formation, dissolution, and material loss under controlled turbulent boundary layers.
- Mechanistic investigation of corrosion and oxidation in conventional and advanced structural materials, including systematic studies of stainless steels, FeCrAl alloys, and other emerging materials to elucidate degradation pathways in liquid-metal environments.

Overall, my work seeks to construct a unified, physics-based framework describing how turbulence, interfacial reaction kinetics, and phase evolution collectively govern corrosion, erosion, and mass transport in structural materials. This mechanistic understanding underpins the development of predictive degradation models, performance-driven material qualification, and improved engineering strategies for next-generation liquid-metal-cooled nuclear systems.
