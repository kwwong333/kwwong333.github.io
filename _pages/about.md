I am Kin Wing Wong, a Ph.D. student specializing in [Nuclear Engineering](https://www.reactor.sci.kth.se/nuclear-engineering-1.792022) at the [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se) in Stockholm, Sweden. 
My current work at KTH focuses on the system scale and computational fluid dynamics modelling of of turbulent transport and corrosion–erosion phenomena in heavy liquid metal (HLM), assisted with experimental investigation of corrosion and erosion phenomenon on conventional and advanced structural steels. 

Computational Fluid Dynamics and Method Development
- Performed Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) modeling of experimental facilities at KTH to characterize turbulent flow structures and define prototypical operating conditions relevant to thermal-hydraulic systems.
- Developed hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian numerical frameworks coupling high-fidelity CFD solvers with Random Walk Monte Carlo (RWMC) and Population Balance Equation (PBE) models for turbulent mixing, nucleation, and precipitation dynamics.
- Independently developed immersed-boundary-based computational methods to resolve two-way coupling between evolving surface topography and turbulent scalar transport.

Experimental Thermal-Hydraulics and Materials Degradation
- Contributed to the design and operation of high-temperature liquid-metal corrosion and rotating-disk erosion facilities for quantitative assessment of material degradation under well-characterized turbulent boundary-layer conditions.
- Conducted experimental investigations of corrosion, erosion, and erosion-assisted corrosion mechanisms to support mechanistic understanding relevant to reactor thermal-hydraulics and structural materials.
