<summary><strong> Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter (Thermal Hydraulic and Severe Accident Code Developer) — Abteilung Kühlkreislauf (Cooling Circuit Department), Safety Research Section, Gesellschaft für Anlagen- und Reaktorsicherheit (GRS) gGmbH, Munich, Germany (Dec 2019 - Feb 2022)</strong>
</summary>
  
- Responsible for code development of system codes, AC$^2$/ATHLET and AC$^2$/ATHLET-CD for simulation of thermohydraulic (TH) and severe accident (SA) phenomena.
  
- Examining the partitioning of wall heat fluxes and the condensation process at the interface to determine subcooled boiling at low pressure and flow instability. The critical heat flux model for narrow rectangular geometric channels was implemented and validated.
  
- Created a model to calculate the temporary retention of molten material at the location of spacer grids, as well as the associated energy transfer and failure. The model was implemented to account for changes in the properties and reaction rates during eutectic interaction and nitride formation in a BWR melt.

<summary><strong> Safety Analysis Intern, Abteilung Sicherheit (Deterministic Safety Department), Kernkraftwerk (Nuclear Power Plant) Gösgen (KKG), Däniken, Switzerland (Jul 2018 - Oct 2018)</strong>
</summary>
  
- Verified the accuracy of the TRACE-KKG package against AREVA's calculations for various sizes of Small Break Loss of Coolant Accidents (SBLOCA) during a Station Blackout (SBO) scenario.
  
- Examined the effects of "direct injection" and "emergency borated water spraying" on plant responses to inform potential modifications to the plant in the future.

- Published an internal safety report for KKG, "Assessment of TRACE\_KKG for LOCA scenarios under Station Blackout conditions without single failure".
