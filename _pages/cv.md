Work experience
======
**Doctoral Student**  
**Division of Nuclear Science and Engineering, Department of Physics**  
**KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden**  
**Feb 2022 – Present**
- Conducted experimental investigation and multi-scale modeling of turbulent transport and corrosion–erosion phenomena in heavy liquid metal (HLM) systems.
- Developed a computational framework for flow-accelerated corrosion and erosion spanning system-scale and CFD-scale analyses.
- Designed and operated high-temperature liquid-metal corrosion and rotating-disk erosion facilities to quantify corrosion kinetics, oxide formation, and erosive material loss under controlled turbulent boundary-layer conditions.
- Performed experimental characterizations of corrosion damage and erosion-assisted corrosion mechanisms in conventional and advanced structural materials.
- Developed a hybrid numerical framework coupling high-fidelity Eulerian computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers with Lagrangian Random Walk Monte Carlo (RWMC) methods to resolve scalar mixing in high Schmidt turbulent flows.
- Extended the hybrid Eulerian–RWMC framework by coupling population balance equations (PBE) with precipitate nucleation and growth models to capture turbulence-induced nucleation and growth processes.
- Developed a MPI-accelerated immersed-boundary-based finite volume CFD code to investigate the feedbacks between evolving surface topography and turbulent flow and scalar dynamics.

**Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter (Thermal Hydraulic and Severe Accident Code Developer)**  
**Cooling Circuit Department (Abteilung Kühlkreislauf)**  
**Safety Research Section**  
**Gesellschaft für Anlagen- und Reaktorsicherheit (GRS) gGmbH, Munich, Germany**  
**Dec 2019 – Feb 2022**
- Developed, implemented, and maintained thermohydraulic (TH) and severe accident (SA) models in the AC²/ATHLET and AC²/ATHLET-CD system codes, contributing directly to their predictive capabilities for reactor safety analysis.
- Implemented and validated wall heat-flux partitioning and interfacial condensation models for subcooled boiling, with application to flow-instability prediction in pool-type research reactors.
- Implemented, verified, and assessed the Sudo–Kaminaga critical heat flux (CHF) model for narrow rectangular duct geometries, enabling accurate CHF prediction in research reactor simulations.
- Developed and validated a mechanistic model for temporary melt retention at spacer-grid locations, including coupled energy transfer, structural degradation, and failure criteria.
- Implemented eutectic interaction and nitride formation models for boiling water reactor (BWR) melt progression, incorporating phase-diagram-based thermophysical properties and reaction kinetics; achieved significantly improved predictions of hydrogen generation and cladding temperature in simulations of the QUENCH-11 experiment.
- Extended and verified the thermal–structural coupling interface to solid-mechanics solvers, enabling robust external multiphysics coupling through a generic coupling library.

**Safety Analysis Intern**  
**Deterministic Safety Department (Abteilung Sicherheit)**  
**Kernkraftwerk Gösgen (KKG), Däniken, Switzerland**  
**Jul 2018 – Oct 2018**
- Performed comprehensive validation of the TRACE-KKG system code against AREVA reference calculations for multiple Small Break Loss of Coolant Accident (SBLOCA) scenarios under Station Blackout (SBO) conditions, directly supporting reactor safety assessments.
- Investigated the effectiveness of passive and semi-passive mitigation measures, including direct injection and emergency borated-water spraying, through detailed transient simulations, providing quantitative insights relevant to accident-tolerant and SMR safety-system design.
- Authored the safety analysis report “Assessment of TRACE-KKG for LOCA Scenarios under Station Blackout Conditions without Single Failure,” documenting code applicability, model limitations, and safety margins for beyond-design-basis accident scenarios.
