Work experience
======
**Doctoral Student**  
**Division of Nuclear Science and Engineering, Department of Physics**  
**KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden**  
**Feb 2022 – Present**

- Conducting research on turbulent transport, high-Schmidt-number scalar mixing, and corrosion–erosion in heavy liquid metals for next-generation nuclear systems.  
- Developing integrated experimental–computational frameworks combining high-temperature rotating-disk facilities with high-fidelity CFD and Random Walk Monte Carlo (RWMC) models.  
- Implementing immersed-boundary and multi-physics modelling approaches to study surface evolution and material degradation under turbulent flow conditions.

**Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter (Thermal Hydraulic and Severe Accident Code Developer)**  
**Cooling Circuit Department (Abteilung Kühlkreislauf)**  
**Safety Research Section**  
**Gesellschaft für Anlagen- und Reaktorsicherheit (GRS) gGmbH, Munich, Germany**  
**Dec 2019 – Feb 2022**

- Developed models in the AC²/ATHLET and AC²/ATHLET-CD system codes for simulating thermohydraulic (TH) and severe accident (SA) phenomena.  
- Investigated wall heat-flux partitioning and interfacial condensation to predict subcooled boiling, low-pressure flow instability, and critical heat flux in narrow rectangular channels.  
- Implemented and validated a critical heat-flux (CHF) model for advanced reactor channel geometries.  
- Built a mechanistic model for temporary retention and energy transfer of molten material at spacer-grid locations, including changes in material properties and reaction rates during eutectic interaction and nitride formation in BWR melt scenarios.

**Safety Analysis Intern**  
**Deterministic Safety Department (Abteilung Sicherheit)**  
**Kernkraftwerk Gösgen (KKG), Däniken, Switzerland**  
**Jul 2018 – Oct 2018**

- Validated the TRACE-KKG analysis package against AREVA reference calculations for multiple Small Break Loss of Coolant Accident (SBLOCA) scenarios during Station Blackout (SBO).  
- Assessed the effects of direct injection and emergency borated-water spraying on plant transient behaviour, contributing to potential future plant-modification strategies.  
- Authored the internal safety report: *“Assessment of TRACE_KKG for LOCA scenarios under Station Blackout conditions without single failure.”*
