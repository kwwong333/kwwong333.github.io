Work experience
======
**Doctoral Student**  
**Division of Nuclear Science and Engineering, Department of Physics**  
**KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden**  
**Feb 2022 – Present**
- Conduct experimental investigation and multi-scale modeling of turbulent transport and corrosion–erosion phenomena in heavy liquid metal (HLM) systems.
- Developed integrated experimental–computational frameworks for studying flow-accelerated corrosion and erosion under turbulent boundary-layer conditions.
- Designed, built, and operated high-temperature liquid-metal corrosion and rotating-disk erosion facilities to quantify corrosion kinetics, oxide formation, and erosive material loss.
- Performed experimental studies on corrosion damage and erosion-assisted corrosion mechanisms in conventional and advanced structural materials.
- Developed hybrid numerical models coupling high-fidelity Eulerian computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers with Lagrangian Random Walk Monte Carlo (RWMC) methods to resolve non-local turbulent mixing, nucleation, and precipitation processes.
- Implemented population-balance and nucleation models to describe oxide particle growth, shrinkage, dissolution, and transport in turbulent liquid-metal flows.
- Developed immersed-boundary-based computational frameworks to study two-way coupling between evolving surface topography and turbulent flow dynamics.
- Applied advanced numerical techniques, including immersed-boundary and level-set hybrid methods, high-order discretizations for evolving interfaces, and MPI-GPU-accelerated solvers.

**Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter (Thermal Hydraulic and Severe Accident Code Developer)**  
**Cooling Circuit Department (Abteilung Kühlkreislauf)**  
**Safety Research Section**  
**Gesellschaft für Anlagen- und Reaktorsicherheit (GRS) gGmbH, Munich, Germany**  
**Dec 2019 – Feb 2022**

- Developed models in the AC²/ATHLET and AC²/ATHLET-CD system codes for simulating thermohydraulic (TH) and severe accident (SA) phenomena.  
- Investigated wall heat-flux partitioning and interfacial condensation to predict subcooled boiling, low-pressure flow instability, and critical heat flux in narrow rectangular channels.  
- Implemented and validated a critical heat-flux (CHF) model for advanced reactor channel geometries.  
- Built a mechanistic model for temporary retention and energy transfer of molten material at spacer-grid locations, including changes in material properties and reaction rates during eutectic interaction and nitride formation in BWR melt scenarios.

**Safety Analysis Intern**  
**Deterministic Safety Department (Abteilung Sicherheit)**  
**Kernkraftwerk Gösgen (KKG), Däniken, Switzerland**  
**Jul 2018 – Oct 2018**

- Validated the TRACE-KKG analysis package against AREVA reference calculations for multiple Small Break Loss of Coolant Accident (SBLOCA) scenarios during Station Blackout (SBO).  
- Assessed the effects of direct injection and emergency borated-water spraying on plant transient behaviour, contributing to potential future plant-modification strategies.  
- Authored the internal safety report: *“Assessment of TRACE_KKG for LOCA scenarios under Station Blackout conditions without single failure.”*
