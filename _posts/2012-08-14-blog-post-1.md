## Galerkin Approximation of 2D Neutron Diffusion Problem
This is the course project for the finite element course at KTH, which I coded a 2D P1-FEM code to fulfill the doctoral course requirement. The selected problem is the 2D two-group neutron diffusion benchmark.

Let $\tau_h$ be non-overlapping, simplical partition of convex pologonal domain $\Omega \in R^d$, that is also shape-regular and uniform.

The $\tau_h$ on P1-FEM sapce is 

$$ V_{h,0} = {v \in C^0(\Omega) \cup H_0^1(\Omega) | \forall k \in \tau_h: v_k  \text{ is polynomial of degree } 1 } $$


```matlab
DNS_Case = true;
Prep_Case = false;

% They must be opposite (XOR condition)
if ~( xor(DNS_Case, Prep_Case) )
    error('Either one of DNS_Case or Prep_Case must be true.');
end
```
