## Galerkin Approximation of 2D Neutron Diffusion Problem
Let $\tau_h$ be non-overlapping, simplical partition of convex pologonal domain $\Omega \in R^d$, that is also shape-regular and uniform.

The $\tau_h$ on P1-FEM sapce is 

$$ V_{h,0} = {v \in C^0(\Omega) \union H_0^1(\Omega) | \forall k \in \tau_h: v_k  \text{ is polynomial of degree } 1 } $$
